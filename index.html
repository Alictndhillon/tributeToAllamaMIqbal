          <h2>A Great Poet of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Muhammad Iqbal (9 November 1877 </b> – 21 April 1938) was a South
            Asian Muslim philosopher,[1][2] author,[3] and politician.[4] His
            poetry is considered to be among the greatest of the 20th
            century,[5][6][7][8] and his vision of a cultural and political
            ideal for the Muslims of British-ruled India[9] is widely regarded
            as having animated the impulse for the Pakistan Movement.[1][10] He
            is commonly referred to by the honourific Allama (Persian: علامه,
            transl. "learned").[11][12] Born and raised in Sialkot, Punjab Iqbal
            completed his BA and MA at the Government College in Lahore. He
            taught Arabic at the Oriental College in Lahore from 1899 until
            1903, during which time he wrote prolifically. Notable among his
            Urdu poems from this period are "Parinde ki Faryad" (translated as
            "A Bird's Prayer"), an early contemplation on animal rights, and
            "Tarana-e-Hindi" (translated as "Anthem of India"), a patriotic
            poem—both composed for children. In 1905, he departed from India to
            pursue further education in Europe, first in England and later in
            Germany. In England, he earned a second BA at Trinity College,
            Cambridge, and subsequently qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's
            Inn. In Germany, he obtained a PhD in philosophy at the University
            of Munich, with his thesis focusing on "The Development of
            Metaphysics in Persia" in 1908. Upon his return to Lahore in 1908,
            Iqbal established a law practice but primarily focused on producing
            scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy, and
            religion. He is most renowned for his poetic compositions, including
            "Asrar-e-Khudi," for which he was honored with a British knighthood
            upon its publication,[13] "Rumuz-e-Bekhudi," and "Bang-e-Dara." His
            literary works in the Persian language garnered him recognition in
            Iran, where he is commonly known as Iqbal-e Lahori, meaning "Iqbal
            of Lahore." Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and
            spiritual revival of the Muslim world as a whole, but particularly
            of the Muslims in the Indian subcontinent; a series of lectures he
            delivered to this effect were published as The Reconstruction of
            Religious Thought in Islam in 1930. He was elected to the Punjab
            Legislative Council in 1927 and held several positions in the
            All-India Muslim League. In his Allahabad Address, delivered at the
            League's annual assembly in 1930, he formulated a political
            framework for the Muslim-majority regions spanning northwestern
            India, spurring the League's pursuit of the Two-Nation Theory.[9] In
            August 1947, nine years after Iqbal's death, the partition of India
            gave way to the establishment of Pakistan, a newly independent
            Islamic state in which Iqbal was honoured as the national poet. He
            is also known in Pakistani society as Hakeem-ul-Ummat (lit. 'The
            Wise Man of the Ummah') and as Mufakkir-e-Pakistan (lit. 'The
            Thinker of Pakistan'). The anniversary of his birth (Yom-e Weladat-e
